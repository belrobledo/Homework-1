    Homework 4)
        For the following Θ-difficulties, write strict and non-strict O-limits and, optionally, strict and non-strict Ω-limits (provided that they exist).
            1. Θ( 1 )
            2. Θ( √n )
            3. Θ( n )
            4. Θ( n^2 )
            5. Θ( n^3 )

    1.  Worst case or non-strict upper bound: Big-O: O(1)
        Best case or non-strict lower bound: Big-Omega: Ω(1)
        Average case: Big-Theta: Θ(1)
        Strict upper bound: o(1)
        Strict lower bound: ω(1)

    NOTE: I have a question for this exercise, how can we find the upper and lower bounds if we only know the average value and don't see the actual function?
    In the case of Θ(1) it's easy because time complexity of the algorithm is constant, so it's always 1. But for the other cases I didn't understand how to calculate them.
